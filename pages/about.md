## About the Exhibition
This is an exhibit created and curated by students in VISA 2P90 (Victorian Visual Culture) at Brock University. 

Images from the 19th century are super cool. We should all learn more about them. Yay! 
What else can I say here? 
Testing, testing, testing.



The base site features objects from the [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/) and the [Wellcome Collection](https://wellcomecollection.org/collections).
